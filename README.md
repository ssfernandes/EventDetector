DESCRIPTION
-----------
     MATLAB implementation of our Windowed Tensor Decomposition Event Detector for Time-evolving networks
       
FILES
-----
    For illustration purposes, we provide a sythetic time-evolving network (datasets/synthi.mat) and a 
    demo file (demo.m).
    In the demo, we apply our method (eventdetector) with varying window lengths and number of factors and 
    then rank the instants abnormality according to the manuscript procedure using top_events function.
 
DEPENDECIES
-----------
    Our code makes use of the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB, which is avialable at
        http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/.
